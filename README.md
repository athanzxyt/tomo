# tomo landing

Minimal Next.js (App Router) site for the tomo landing page. The UI is intentionally bare: a single centered line of copy rendered with Tailwind CSS.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the landing page. Edit `app/page.tsx` to adjust the copy or styling.
